# 🎬 Movie Search App

Welcome to the **Movie Search App**! 🎥🍿 This is a simple, beginner-friendly React app that lets you search for your favorite movies using the OMDB API. It's a fun project to help you learn React, API integration, and some Tailwind CSS for styling.

## 🌟 Features

- **Search for Movies**: Type in the name of your favorite movie, and the app will fetch results from the OMDB database.
- **Display Movie Info**: See the title, poster, and year of release for each movie.
- **Responsive Design**: The app looks great on all devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **OMDB API**: A free API to get movie information.
